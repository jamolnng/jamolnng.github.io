    <strong>EDUCATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Kansas State University, </strong>Manhattan, KS<br />
    Expected Graduation May 2020<br /> B.S. Physics, Computer Science<br />
    Minor: Mathematics<br />
    GPA: 3.6/4.0
</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>
    <strong>The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.</strong><br />
    <em>Software Engineer Intern</em><br />
    January 2018 &ndash; July 2018, June 2019 &ndash; Present
</p>
<p>Worked in a small team to design and develop a python testing interface to enable quick and rigorous testing of
    mission critical software for the Dream Chaser Space Vehicle. Had to develop a thorough understanding of the
    hardware and software interfaces in order to ensure correct behavior and results.

<p>
    <strong>Kansas State Department of Physics</strong><br />
    <em>Digital Holography Research Assistant</em><br />
    May 2017 &ndash; December 2017, August 2018 &ndash; May 2019
</p>
<p>Design and develop an instrument to image large in-situ aerosol particles from an unmanned aerial vehicle.
    Responsible for hardware and software engineering for the embedded system that controls lasers, a camera, and
    detection of the particles.
</p>
<p>
    <em>EM Scattering Research Assistant</em><br />
    January 2016 &ndash; May 2017
</p>
<p>Designed and developed multi-processor capable computational code based on Mie theory solutions for spherical
    particles to investigate the internal fields of large spheres. The internal fields were systematically studied to
    search for underlying structures that influence the behavior of the scattered fields.
