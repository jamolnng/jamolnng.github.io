title: Mini Mike's Metro Minis for Unreal Engine
---

Over the past week or so I have been working on setting up [Mini Mike's Metro Minis](http://mikelovesrobots.github.io/mmmm/) for Unreal Engine. I am mostly done I just need to finish up the house, store, building objects.

What I have done that separates these from the original is that they are now formatted for Unreal Engine. Each model has been imported correctly and turned into an Unreal asset (.uasset). The textures for the models have also been created as Unreal assets along with adding a material for each model. Each model now has it's own collision mesh based on its geometry. Finally I created a custom 3rd person character controller that gives the character a goofy walking style.

The project can be found on my [github](https://github.com/jamolnng/mmmm)

A demo of all of this can be seen here in this video https://youtu.be/v4JX-m5XHcw
