title: Switched to Github.io and Jekyll
---

I decided to move my website hosting off of my own server to keep it up and maintained as much as possible. I can still host websites on my server for things that require it, but for my personal website I am sticking with Github.io. I recently found I could have it use my domain name and that is what convinced me to use it. A great advantage is that it uses Jekyll to create webpages, something that I did not think to use and have been writing pretty much all the html for my website in the past, except for the php-sql blog. This looks like a much better option than what I was doing.
