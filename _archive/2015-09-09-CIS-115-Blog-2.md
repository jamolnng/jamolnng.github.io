Margaret Hamilton has always been interesting to me because I love space, NASA, and specifically the Apollo program that led us to the moon. She worked along side my grandfather as he was the one of the people who helped develop guidance systems for the Apollo missions and they both worked at Draper. Ever since I started learning about space, rockets, and specifically the Apollo missions I have always been interested in the computer hardware and software that got us there and Margaret Hamilton is someone who I have always seen as being one of the people who led us there. Her work on the Apollo missions is one of the biggest infuences on my life. If I could ask her any questions some would be if she knew the impact she would make on technology and the advancement of computers and computer science. Also I would ask about how they used to program the computers. Without Margaret Hamilton I think computer science would not have moved away from the hardware. That hardware engineers would also be the ones designing the software as well.

Margaret Hamilton created Hamilton Technologies, Inc. and is currently the CEO. Margaret Hamilton got a degree in math and taught high school math and French until she moved to Boston, Massachusetts. During her career "...[she] has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports concerned with the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved." She wrote software for many early computers. She must have learned all of her programming on the job. A lot of her early software engineering projects were parts of military defense systems such as SAGE or AN/FSQ-7. She eventually took a interim position at MIT to develop software. This position led her to join MIT's Draper Laboratory, which at the time was working on the Apollo space missions where she worked on the guidance systems for the rockets. "She eventually became the director and supervisor of software programming for Apollo and Skylab." Many, if not all, modern computers use the basics of her software designs. For example, parallel computing has been worked into most modern computer and the computer that you are reading this on is most likely using it.<sup>[1]</sup> Along with her work on the Apollo missions she also helped define requirements for software that was used in the Space Shuttle program.<sup>[3]</sup>

Margaret Hamilton won several awards for her work including NASA Exceptional Space Act Award<sup>[2]</sup>, Outstanding Alumni and Distinguished Service Awards at Earlham College, and the Augusta Lovelace Award from the Association for Women in Computing<sup>[3]</sup>
