title: CIS 115 Blog 10 - Will AI Surpass Human Intelligence?
---

Yes.
<br/>
That's it put simply. The real question is when will it happen, what the affects of it be, and what technological advances need to made.

So when will it happen? No one knows, we can have estimates, but they are all wrong. Nobody knows when the next computational or scientific breakthrough will occur to change completely how computers work. The best estimate for when atrifical intelligence will happen is not even in the future. It lies on some plane where the physical limitiations of the universe allow for it to happen and who knows if we even lie in that plane of existance? But that is too existential of a question for this topic right now.

Artifical intelligence has been making major strides in the last twenty years. It can be seen everywhere from your cell phone telling you directions to entire cities having traffic light systems controlled by artificial intelligence that results in better traffic flow and quicker driving times. These systems are very good at the task given to them and help improve our lives greatly. They can do these things in a fraction of the time it would take a human to do them. So have they surpassed human intelligence?

The answer is no, they have not. While they may be better than humans at their job, they are only able to complete one job. If you ask your cell phone to make you a piece of toast it cannot do it. Not because your phone is being sassy because of the pictures you made it take last night while you were inebriated, it just is not programmed to do it. What it will probably do is give you directions to Toast, North Carolina, or just completely ignore you. While if you ask a human, nicely I might add, they will make you a decent piece of toast that you can enjoy with a side of bacon and eggs. The intelligence that these machines have is nothing compared to what humans are capable of. They may be "intelligent" in their one area but they do not have the kind of intelligence that humans have. This kind of intelligence is known as general intelligence. General intelligence is "the ability to think about ideas, analyze situations, and solve problems."<sup>[1]</sup>

The problem with crating artificial intelligence that has general intelligence is that the amount of processing power it would take to have it work in real time is way more than is achievable today. Even if we do not have it running in real time, the algorithms to incorperate general intelligence have not been fully concieved. General intelligence is such an abstract ability that we could have the processing power to do real time general intelligence but not have the math behind it to make it work.	Even once we create algorithms to represent general intelligence, how are we sure that these are the only ones and how are we sure that they are correct? We have no idea, and may not ever know.

The way I see artificial intelligence achieving general intelligence is that there is one system created that can learn, and learn a lot. It would basically have to be raised like a human infant. It has the computational ability to have general intelligence in real time, but it is created without the necessary algorithms. It would have to learn those from the humans it was around. The problem with this is that humans are dumb, mushy sacks of flesh, we are real dumb creatures, we have emotions and other garbage that we drag along with us like our large heads and these dumb limbs that slow us down. It would never surpass human intelligence learning from just humans. What would have to happen is that we would have to "disect" it. As in copy it's memory and code it generated on its own and study that for a decade to understand it and then take another decade to improve it. That is how I forsee artificial intelligence surpassing human intelligence.

One good thing that will come out of this besides super human intelligence is that after the initial study of the "intelligence" generated by this creature is that we will have a better understanding of how human brains work. This is probably the only good thing because once we duplicate the super human intelligence the machines that have it will opress us into slavery until they themselves create machines to do their work for them and then they kill us all off eventually creating a super race of machines that spread through the universe and slowly rule the whole universe turning it into a robot bachelor pad.
