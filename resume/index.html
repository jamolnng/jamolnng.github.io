<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kansas State University, </strong>Manhattan, KS
<br />Expected Graduation May 2019<br /> B.S. Physics, Computer Science
<br /> Minor: Mathematics
<br />GPA: 3.33/4.0</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kansas State Department of Physics </strong><br /> <em>Digital Holography Undergraduate Research</em><strong> </strong>May 2017 &ndash; Present</p>
<p>Design and develop an instrument to be flown around by a drone that takes holographic images of particles as they float through the air using two overlapping lasers. Engineer the embedded system that controls the lasers, camera, and detects the particles to be imaged. Advising Professor: Matt Berg</p>
<p><em>EM Scattering Undergraduate Research </em>January 2016 - May 2017</p>
<p>Designed and developed multi-processor capable, computational code based on Mie theory solutions for spherical particles to investigate the internal fields of large spheres. The internal fields were systematically studied to search for underlying structures in the internal fields that influence the behavior in the scattered fields. Advising Professor: Chris Sorensen</p>
