<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kansas State University, </strong>Manhattan, KS Expected Graduation May 2019<br /> B.S. Physics, Computer Science GPA: 3.33/4.0<br /> Minor: Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kansas State Department of Physics </strong><br /> <em>Digital Holography Undergraduate Research</em><strong> </strong>May 2017 - Present</p>
<p><em>EM Scattering Undergraduate Research </em>January 2016 - May 2017</p>
<p>Design and develop parallel capable, computational code based on Mie theory solutions for spherical particles to investigate the internal fields of large spheres. The internal fields were systematically investigated to search for underlying structures in the internal fields that influence the behavior in the scattered fields.</p>
