	I'm a Senior at Kansas State University majoring in Physics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. I
	started teaching myself programming when I was 11 and have not stopped since then and discovered my love for physics
	along the way. I have worked in the fields of scientific computing (Kansas State University), mission critical
	software testing (The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.), and applied optics and instrument design (Kansas State
	University). Currently I am a research assistant for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/emscattering/">Matt
		Berg, a professor at Kansas State University</a>. My work consists of two different jobs:
	<ul>
		<li>Hardware and software development for an instrument to image large aerosol particles from an unmanned aerial
			vehicle.</li>
		<li>Applied optics research in digital holographic imaging of aerosol particles.</li>
	</ul>
