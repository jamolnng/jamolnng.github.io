I am Jesse Laning, I live in the Little Apple, Manhattan, Kansas. I have loved computers since the day I was born. Ever since I got my first computer as a child I have been tinkering with them non stop. I am currently working on my degree in Physics and Software Engineering at Kansas State University. While I have been programming for almost eight years, physics is my life and am currently doing physics research. My favorite pass time is toying around with OpenGL and hopefully soon, Vuklan.


The research I'm involved in, under the leadership of Dr. Amit Chakrabarti, is using the well known Mie solution to Maxwell's equations to understand how the internal fields of spheres affects the development of the scattered fields. Once we gain an understanding of how this works then the same techniques can be applied to irregular shaped particles by using a Discrete Dipole Approximation to light scattering. My task at the moment is to massively parallelize our existing computational code using mutli-cpu or multi-gpu platforms using OpenMP or OpenCL or NVIDIA CUDA (we haven't decided yet).


My eight years of programming experience include programming with C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Lua. What I normally work with, and am most proficient at, is C/C++. I just love to write programs with it and mess around. I especially love using it with OpenGL. I have created my own versions of an OpenGL C++ wrapper, although it is very basic. I am currently working on a game engine using C++ (with SDL) and OpenGL. Graphics cards are just magical pieces of technology that I love to toy with.
