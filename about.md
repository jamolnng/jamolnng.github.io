Programmer for eight years. While not having been formally taught, I have a lot of experience. The primary languages I program in and am very proficient at are:
* C++
* C#
* Java

It is very easy for me to pick up a new programming language. Other languages I have programmed in include JavaScript, Python, Lua, and PHP.
