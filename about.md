<p>I'm a Junior at Kansas State University majoring in Physics and Computer Science. I've spend the last 10+ years teaching myself how to program, mainly with C and C++. During those years I have done everything from command line programs to trying my hand at game making. My main passion is physics and using my programming skill I have gotten into computational physics, working on speeding up calculations with parallel processing. Recently I jumped into the more hands on experimental side of physics.</p>

<p>I have been an employee of the Department of Physics at Kansas State University for over a year and a half now, with a part time job at Baskin Robbin's thrown in there for six months. I am working with professors Chris Sorensen and Matt Berg on theoretical and experimental studies of light scatting by particles of arbitrary shape and size.</p>
