Hello, I am Jesse Laning. I am 18 and I have been a programmer for over six years. While not having been formally taught, I have a lot of experience. The primary languages I program in and am very proficient at are:

- C/C++
- C#
- Java

It is very easy for me to pick up a new programming language. Other languages I have programmed in include JavaScript, Python, Lua, and PHP.

While I enjoy making video games the real fun for me is in the core engine stuff. Things like multithreading audio, rendering, and physics. I am also learning how to use OpenGL to make things look pretty which I think might actually be my new favorite part, even though I'm just starting out.

I am currently a student at K-State Universirty studying physics and computer science. My goal is to work on physics based graphics like lighting, shadows, and reflections to make games and other areas that require real time graphics to look as real as possible, but mostly games. I also like to do physics simulations with computers. One thing I was working on was a "game" called Gravity Boost that simulated the orbits of planets.
